      description: "My name is Alex and I‚Äôm co-directing Oxford Hack this year. I love getting involved in this kind of events and I am more than excited to work with the rest of the committee to make this year‚Äôs event the best that Oxford has seen.<br />I‚Äôm a fairly adventurous and creative person, which is why this role is perfect for me - if you think the same about yourself, you can contact me to talk about how to get involved next year!

      role: Hackathon Director
      description: "Hello! I‚Äôm Serban, pronounced ‚Äòshare-bun‚Äô, and I‚Äôm one of the two hackathon directors.<br />Working with the rest of the team to organise this hackathon is the second most exciting part of my uni life, the first being my boat and all those times I‚Äôve been attacked by geese on the Cherwell river.<br />Luckily, I‚Äôve survived all of them! So if you want to find out more about this or talk about literally anything else (focus on Oxford Hack and how to become a hackathon director yourself), then hit me up on Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SerbanStefanSlincu\">here</a>!"

      role: Marketing Director
      description: "Hey! I‚Äôm Sam, a second-year CompSci and the Marketing Director for Oxford Hack 2019 ‚ú®<br />My responsibility in this little dream team is all things communication and advertising, so if you‚Äôre reading this then I must‚Äôve already done a pretty good job. When I‚Äôm not writing masterpieces for the Facebook page, I enjoy gaming, running, lo-fi hip hop, and rocky road. ‚ù§<br />If you‚Äôd like to talk about my role, the hack, or anything mildly interesting, feel free to drop me an email: samuel.boyer@stcatz.ox.ac.uk üëç"

      description: "Hi! I‚Äôm Josh, a 3rd year Computer Science student and this year‚Äôs Technical Director!

My hobbies include solving rubik‚Äôs cubes and other twisty puzzles, drinking high quality tea, and building little projects to make my life more efficient or interesting.
