Oxford Hack 2019 is the latest incarnation of the university’s annual Hackathon, happening this time on the 16th - 17th November. It’s an exciting, inclusive coding event, encouraging student teams of all backgrounds to build something brilliant - in 24 hours.<br />
With so much talent under one roof, the only limit is your imagination. Step - or dive - out of your comfort zone, try a new language or platform, design a cool game or train an ingenious model: the choice is up to you.<br />
We’re looking for teams of motivated students with the creative and technical flair required to make a great product - regardless of prior hackathon experience. If this sounds like you, then be sure to apply!<br />

This event is partnered with Major League Hacking. We’ll be following MLH’s Code of Conduct, which you can find <a href="http://mlh.io/code-of-conduct">here</a>.
