      name: Hack (for) The Planet
      description: "For this award, you’ve got to think big.<br />Big enough to save the world from the climate crisis, the seas from pollution, or any of the issues we’re facing. Your product can help raise awareness about energy usage, advocate for public transport or recycling, or any other topic that impacts our planet. True change requires everyone to be on board, so the product should be as user-friendly as possible!"

      name: Most Entertaining Hack
      description: "Make something fun!<br />Your product is positively brimming with amusement and charm. It isn’t necessarily a game, as long as it creates an enjoyable experience. While bugs and glitches can sometimes be funny, we don’t want to laugh at incompleteness, so you’ll need quality along with your entertainment!"

      name: Hackers' Choice
      description: "Give the people what they want!<br />We don’t actually know what you should make for this award, since it’ll be voted for by your fellow attendees. Perhaps you can build a cool toolset to improve their productivity, or appeal to their fun side with a witty pitch. Think about a product you’d like to see made by another team - chances are your result will be appreciated by others too!"

      name: Most Inventive Hack
      description: "Make something innovative!<br />Your team’s not just thinking outside the box - they’re thinking outside the whole building. Your product might solve a problem we didn’t even know we had, in a way we didn’t even know could be done. You could utilize new technologies, or apply your avant-garde ideas to established workflows - as long as it’s remarkable!"

      name: Most Stylish Hack
      description: "Make something dazzling!<br />24 hours doesn’t give much opportunity to make a well-polished interface, but this product made time for it, and more. Your product is intuitive and responsive, and has a generally good-looking design. It’s hard to convey all this in an elevator pitch, so try and get a working demo for people to try out!"
    - picture: socialgood.png
      name: Hack for Social Good
      description: "Make something to enhance society!<br />Your product takes an innovative stance to solve a problem for society - be it education, healthcare, social media, or anything else you think could be improved. The product could help charities accomplish their goals, raise awareness of misinformation, or evolve the public political discourse. Accessibility is vital if you want widespread use of your product!"

      name: "'Hackiest' Hack"
      description: "It works! ...surprisingly.<br />For this award, your project takes on an ambitious challenge, and just about pulls it off. You could mix a handful of tools together, use APIs in unexpected ways, or partake in other dubious acts to get your idea off the ground. Many powerful projects rely on other technologies, and your team’s masterful at getting them to work together."

      name: Cisco Collaboration Challenge
      description: "Cisco collaboration has a history of connecting people with voice and video for thirty years, with Cisco Webex hosting over 85 billion minutes of meetings ever year. Despite this, there are still unexplored ways people could be brought together with technology. We challenge participants to find a way to connect people in a new way – hacks will be judged on originality, usefulness, along with a special prize for greatest distance! While video is our strength (and you can certainly pick our brains for how to do things with it), any and all ideas are welcomed. For those who want at least some of the work of sending messages across the internet done for them, we're running a workshop to show teams how to build a chatbot on Webex Teams, but our technology is here to help, not a requirement!"
