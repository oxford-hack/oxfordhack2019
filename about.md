[MLH Code of Conduct](http://mlh.io/code-of-conduct)

Oxford University’s official hackathon, returning for 2019.  
It’s an exciting, inclusive coding event, encouraging student teams of all backgrounds to build something brilliant - in 24 hours.  
With so much talent under one roof, the only limit is your imagination. Step - or dive - out of your comfort zone, try a new language or platform, design a game or train a model: the choice is up to you.  
Sounds interesting? Apply for a place below!
